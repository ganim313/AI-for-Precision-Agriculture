## Goal
I'm building a digital farm assistant that helps farmers make better decisions. Here's what it does:
1. Crop Selection: Suggests which crops will grow best in your field based on your local weather and soil type.
2. Fertilizer Guide: Tells you exactly what nutrients your soil needs and when to apply them, so you don't waste money on unnecessary fertilizers.
3. Pest Management: Helps identify common pests and recommends the right pesticides to use, ensuring you treat the problem effectively without overusing chemicals.

The goal is simple: help farmers grow more food while spending less money and resources by making smarter, data-driven decisions.
